<h2> What is Flight dance finder? </h2>

However, there are many factors that could prevent individuals
from persuing dance, even for fun. A major reason is shyness,
being embarrassed to attend alone or no longer having a dance
partner. Therefore Flight dance finder aims to bring people who are
passionate about dancing together.
